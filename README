mpvwincycle
===========

Script to switch between multiple mpv media player windows on Linux.

What?
-----

If you, like me, use to have multiple mpv windows open, at some point
you start looking for a convenient, keyboard driven way to switch
between them.

And what would "switching" mean, precisely? It means shifting the
unmute status from one window to another. Enlarge a window while doing
that. And optionally give it the focus. All this at once, with a
single key binding, and in a cyclic fashion through all open windows.

Providing such functionality is what this script tries to accomplish.
